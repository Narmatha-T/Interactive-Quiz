# Interactive-Quiz
Competitive Skill type quiz questions tested offline using BlueJ(IDE)

## Cheerio to my first project of my life!!
This was my 10th grade(2016) final project for my Java programming although I had learnt the basics of QBasic(although its dying ;D it was great back then!), c and c++ during(6th, 7th and 8th grade). Later on I've done a TicTacToe game which is also attached.
Further my java skills moved to NetBeans(IDE) and Swing(GUI) during PUC along with HTML, XML and MySQL.
Enough of my route to programming :) I'm glad you read so far of my life!
This project comprises skill type quiz questions tested offline. 
I have done this project using the JAVA software in BlueJ IDE. 

## It is a menu driven program of 6 menu. 
- **Sports** -tests based on Sports of recent times and 
olden days.
- **IQ Tests** -tests your IQ
- **Brain Challenges** -gives a good challenging questions 
to your brain 
- **Science Nature** -sci-fie based questions
- **Mental Ability** -checks your calculating skills
- **Exit** -Stops the execution and exitâ€™s from the program.

I have also uploaded the Synopsis, Algorithm, Flowchart and Outputs of the project in the attached pdf.
Also has Question Banks for Java attached with solutions.

## Brief
By the end we will be able to have basic understanding of Java.

Any queries with the code or Question Bank? Feel free to contribute or email me at - thiyagarajannarmatha@gmail.com
